#Master-Control-Program#

##MCP##
Master Control Program will be an all inclusive program running alongside your desktop providing special functions for the user

also play games:
  - tic-tac-toe
  - dots
  - chess
  - minesweeper
  
Will practice AI management!


Ideas:

JSAPI -> Recognize user speech : maybe look into androids packages as well. Google perhapss
Java or C# could work well. 

Add shortcut phrases to API like: Computer, Open Eclipse -> redirects to opening Eclipse program which the user provides a hardlink to the program locale. essentially add shortcuts in a subfolder called like quicklinks or something to facilitate faster easier controls on the program

maybe run command line things like typing or something IDK could be cool
